\title{Bossom tree graph estimation and density estimation}
\description{
The main function for bossom tree graph estimation and density estimation.
}
\usage{
blossomTree(data, lambda = NULL, refit = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{
An \code{n} by \code{d} data matrix, where \code{n} is the sample size and \code{d} is the dimension.
}
\item{lambda}{
A sequence of positive numbers to control the regularization of the graphical lasso.
}
\item{refit}{
If \code{refit = TRUE}, the refit graphical lasso is applied. The default value is \code{FALSE}.
}
\item{verbose}{
If \code{verbose = FALSE}, tracing information printing is disabled. The default value is \code{TRUE}.
}
}
\details{
The refit graphical lasso is a two-step procedure: in the first step, a sparse inverse covariance matrix is obtained by the graphical lasso; in the second step, a Gaussian model is refit without regularization, but enforcing the sparsity pattern obtained in the first step.
}
\value{
\item{loglike}{
Held-out log-likelihood for a family of blossom tree density estimators with \code{m=1,...,d-1} forest edges.
}
\item{adj}{
Adjacency matrices of a family of blossom tree graphs with \code{m=1,...,d-1} forest edges.
}
\item{best.loglike}{
Maximum of the held-out log-likelihood.
}
\item{best.adj}{
Adjacency matrix of the optimal blossom tree graph corresponding to the maximum of the held-out log-likelihood.
